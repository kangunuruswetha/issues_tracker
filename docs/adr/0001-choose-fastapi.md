# 0001 - Choose FastAPI for Backend API

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The assessment requires a robust and performant backend API for the "Issues & Insights Tracker" application. Key considerations include:
* **Performance:** Ability to handle requests efficiently.
* **Development Speed:** Rapid API development given the project scope and time constraints.
* **Asynchronous Capabilities:** Support for I/O-bound operations (e.g., database interactions, potentially future real-time features like web sockets).
* **API Documentation:** Automatic generation of clear and interactive API documentation.
* **Type Hinting:** Support for modern Python features for better code quality and maintainability.

## Decision
We choose **FastAPI** as the primary framework for the backend API.

## Consequences
### Positive
* **High Performance:** FastAPI is built on Starlette and Pydantic, leveraging ASGI for excellent asynchronous performance, Which I found very efficient for database interactions.
* **Fast Development:** Its reliance on Python type hints significantly reduces boilerplate code, leading to quicker development cycles, it helps to balance the given assessment timeline.
* **Automatic Documentation:** Integrates Swagger UI (OpenAPI) and ReDoc out-of-the-box, providing interactive and self-updating API documentation, which is crucial for frontend integration and future maintenance.
* **Robust Type Hinting:** Pydantic models ensure data validation and serialization/deserialization, catching errors early and improving code reliability.
* **Asynchronous Support:** Native support for `async/await` syntax makes handling concurrent I/O operations straightforward.
* **Ease of Testing:** The framework design facilitates writing clear and efficient tests.

### Negative
* **Learning Curve (Minor):** While generally straightforward for Python developers, grasping ASGI concepts or advanced dependency injection might require a small initial investment.
* **Maturity (Relative):** Newer than some older frameworks like Django/Flask, though it is very stable and widely adopted.

## Alternatives Considered
* **Flask:** While lightweight and flexible, Flask requires more boilerplate for features like data validation and automatic documentation, and its native asynchronous support is less direct than FastAPI's.
* **Django REST Framework (DRF):** A powerful full-featured framework, but it comes with a larger overhead for a "mini SaaS" project, potentially increasing complexity and setup time beyond what's necessary for this assessment's scope.
